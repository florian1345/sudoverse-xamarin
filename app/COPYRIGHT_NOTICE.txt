The touch effect handling is copied from the TouchTrackingEffect sample in the
Xamarin.Forms samples repository.

https://github.com/xamarin/xamarin-forms-samples/tree/main/Effects/TouchTrackingEffect

The following files in this project were copied from the example.

- Sudoverse/Sudoverse/Touch/*
- Sudoverse/Sudoverse.Android/TouchEffect.cs
- Sudoverse/Sudoverse.iOS/TouchEffect.cs
- Sudoverse/Sudoverse.iOS/TouchRecognizer.cs
- Sudoverse/Sudoverse.UWP/TouchEffect.cs

The files have been adapted to match the namespaces and other identifiers in
this project. Where possible, the "sealed" modifier has been added. Whitespace
may have been altered.
